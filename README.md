The solution stores the patient health data in blockchain. Patient can give access to doctor to add the health record upon visiting doctor.
After health record has been added, patient can revok doctor access. Doctor can only see the patient past records records once patient provides 
access, and he can add any new record of the patient. This way doctor dont need to ask patient his path health details and patient dont need to
remember his past health details and hence provides the trusted information and also replaces the traditional paper format.

Patient can add his basic profile details. Doctor can add his basic profile, specialization and work experience which patient can see.
